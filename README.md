This is the MATLAB code for  reproducing the results
as described in

"A Sparse Auditory Envelope Representation with Iterative
Reconstruction for Audio Coding"
Ph.D. Thesis,  Joachim Thiemann, March 2011

All you need to do to run this code is to point
the "audioread" function in the main script
`RunThesisCode.m` to a mono 16kHz audio file,
then run the script.  The variable `x_out` will
be the reconstructed audio.
